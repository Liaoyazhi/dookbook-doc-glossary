TOPIC: Array

# Array

An **array** is an **ordered collection** of data (either *primitive* or *object* depending upon the
language).
Arrays are used to store multiple values in a single variable.
This is compared to a variable that can store only one value.

Each item in an array has a number attached to it, called a **numeric index**,
that allows you to access it. In lots of programming language, such [[JavaScript]], C/C++, [[Java]],
arrays start at index *zero* (`0`) and can be manipulated with various *methods*.
