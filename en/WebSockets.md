TOPIC: WebSocket

# WebSocket

**WebSocket** is a *protocol* that allows for a *persistent TCP connection* between server and
client so they can exchange data at any time.

Any client or server application can use *WebSocket*, but principally web browsers and web servers.
Through WebSocket, servers can pass data to a client without prior client request,
allowing for dynamic content updates.
