# Git

**Git** is a free, open-source, distributed Source Code Management (SCM) system. It facilitates
handling code bases with distributed development teams. What sets it apart from previous SCM systems
is the ability to do common operations (branching, committing, etc.) on your local development machine,
without having to change the master repository or even having write access to it.
