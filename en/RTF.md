# RTF

RTF (Rich Text Format) is a plain-text-based file format with support for formatting
instructions (like bold or italic).

Three programmers in the Microsoft Word team created RTF in the 1980s, and Microsoft
continued to develop the format until 2008. However, many word-processing programs can
still read and write RTF.
