# Normative

Normative is a word commonly used in software specifications to denote sections that are standardized
and must be followed as a rule. Specifications might also contain sections that are marked as
non-normative or informative, which means those are provided there for the purpose of helping the
reader understand the specifications better or to showcase an example or best practice,
which need not be followed as a rule.
