# HyperText Markup Language (HTML)

**HTML** (*HyperText Markup Language*) is a descriptive language that specifies webpage structure.

## Brief History

In 1990, as part of his vision of the [[Web]], *Tim Berners-Lee* defined the concept of **hypertext**,
which *Berners-Lee* formalized the following year through a markup mainly based on *SGML*. The [[IETF]]
began formally specifying HTML in 1993, and after several drafts released version 2.0 in 1995.
In 1994 *Berners-Lee* founded the **[[W3C]]** to develop the Web. In 1996, the W3C took over the HTML
work and published the HTML 3.2 recommendation a year later. *HTML 4.0* was released in 1999 and
became an ISO standard in 2000.

At that time, the W3C nearly abandoned HTML in favor of *XHTML*, prompting the founding of an
independent group called **[[WHATWG]]** in 2004. Thanks to WHATWG, work on *HTML5* continued: the two
organizations released the first draft in 2008 and the final standard in 2014.

## Concept And Syntax

An HTML document is a plaintext document structured with elements. Elements are surrounded by
matching opening and closing TOPIC. Each tag begins and ends with angle brackets (`<>`). There are a
few empty or void TOPIC that cannot enclose any text, for instance `<img>`.

You can extend HTML TOPIC with attributes, which provide additional information affecting how the
browser interprets the element:

An HTML file is normally saved with an `.htm` or `.html` extension, served by a web server,
and can be rendered by any Web browser.

### Hyperlink

**Hyperlinks** connect webpages or data items to one another. In HTML, `<a>` elements define hyperlinks
from a spot on a webpage (like a text string or image) to another spot on some other webpage
(or even on the same page).

### Hypertext

**Hypertext** is text that contains links to other texts, as opposed to a single linear flow like in
a novel.

The term was coined by *Ted Nelson* around 1965.

## HTML5

The latest stable release of HTML, **HTML5** takes HTML from a simple markup for structuring a document
to a full app development platform. Among other features, HTML5 includes new elements and JavaScript
APIs to enhance storage, multimedia, and hardware access.

## DHTML

**DHTML** (*Dynamic HTML*) refers to the code behind interactive webpages that need no plugins like
*Flash* or *Java*. DHTML aggregates the combined functionality of HTML, CSS, the DOM,
and [[JavaScript]].
