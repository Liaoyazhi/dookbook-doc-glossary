# HyperText Markup Language (HTML)

**HTML** (HyperText Markup Language) is a descriptive language that specifies webpage structure.

## Brief History

In 1990, as part of his vision of the Web, *Tim Berners-Lee* defined the concept of hypertext,
which *Berners-Lee* formalized the following year through a markup mainly based on SGML. The IETF
began formally specifying HTML in 1993, and after several drafts released version 2.0 in 1995.
In 1994 *Berners-Lee* founded the W3C to develop the Web. In 1996, the W3C took over the HTML work
and published the HTML 3.2 recommendation a year later. HTML 4.0 was released in 1999 and
became an ISO standard in 2000.

At that time, the W3C nearly abandoned HTML in favor of XHTML, prompting the founding of an
independent group called **WHATWG** in 2004. Thanks to WHATWG, work on HTML5 continued: the two
organizations released the first draft in 2008 and the final standard in 2014.

## Concept And Syntax

An HTML document is a plaintext document structured with elements. Elements are surrounded by
matching opening and closing TOPIC. Each tag begins and ends with angle brackets (`<>`). There are a
few empty or void TOPIC that cannot enclose any text, for instance `<img>`.

You can extend HTML TOPIC with attributes, which provide additional information affecting how the
browser interprets the element:

An HTML file is normally saved with an `.htm` or `.html` extension, served by a web server,
and can be rendered by any Web browser.

## HTML5

The latest stable release of HTML, **HTML5** takes HTML from a simple markup for structuring a document
to a full app development platform. Among other features, HTML5 includes new elements and JavaScript
APIs to enhance storage, multimedia, and hardware access.
