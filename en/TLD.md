# TLD

A TLD (top-level domain) is the most generic domain in the Internet's hierarchical DNS
(domain name system). A TLD is the final component of a domain name, for example, "org" in `developer.mozilla.org`.

ICANN (Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers) designates organizations to manage each
TLD. Depending on how strict an administrating organization might be, TLD often serves as a clue to
the purpose, ownership, or nationality of a website.

Consider an example Internet address: `https://developer.mozilla.org`
Here org is the TLD; mozilla.org is the second-level domain name; and developer is a subdomain name.
All together, these constitute a fully-qualified domain name; the addition of `https://`
makes this a complete URL.

IANA today distinguishes the following groups of top-level domains:

**country-code top-level domains (ccTLD)**:

Two-character domains established for countries or territories. Example: .us for United States.
internationalized country code top-level domains (IDN ccTLD)
ccTLDs in non-Latin character sets (e.g., Arabic or Chinese).

**generic top-level domains (gTLD)**:

Top-level domains with three or more characters.
unsponsored top-level domains
Domains that operate directly under policies established by ICANN processes for the global Internet
community, for example "com" and "edu".

**sponsored top-level domains (sTLD)**:

These domains are proposed and sponsored by private organizations that decide whether an applicant
is eligible to use the TLD, based on community theme concepts.

**infrastructure top-level domain**:

This group consists of one domain, the Address and Routing Parameter Area (ARPA).
