# XHTML

HTML can travel over the network to a browser either in [[HTML]] syntax or an XML syntax called XHTML.

## HTML5 and HTML/XHTML

The **HTML5 standard** defines both these syntaxes.  The [[MIME]] type
(sent in the [[HTTP]] `Content-Type` header) indicates the choice of syntax: for XHTML the [[MIME]]
type will be  `application/xhtml+xml`, otherwise `text/html`.

This example shows an [[HTML]] document and an XHTML document including the appropriate [[HTTP]] headers:

### HTML document

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/html

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang=en>
  <head>
    <meta charset=utf-8>
    <title>HTML</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>I am a HTML document</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

### XHTML document

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/xhtml+xml

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xml:lang="en">
  <head>
    <title>XHTML</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>I am a XHTML document</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

## MIME type versus DOCTYPE

Before HTML5, the two separate specifications defined the two syntaxes
([HTML 4.01 Specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/html401/) and [XHTML 1.0 specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1)).
According to the XHTML1 standard,
you could use XHTML by declaring a special **DOCTYPE**. However, no browsers have ever implemented this,
and the HTML5 standard has reversed the decision.
**If your page is sent as `text/html`, you are not using XHTML**.

Instead, the proper [[MIME]] type must be present in the `Content-Type` [[HTTP]] header. If you only
put the [[MIME]] type into an [[HTML]] meta tag like `<meta http-equiv=â€¦>`, it will be ignored and
treated like `text/html`.

If you serve your pages as `text/html` and believe that you are writing XHTML, you may face several
problems, as described in these articles:

## Support

Most browsers currently support XHTML, including [[Mozilla Firefox]], [[Google Chrome]],
[[Apple Safari]], Opera, and Internet Explorer (since IE 9). (Internet Explorer 8 and older
browsers instead show a download dialog box for unknown file types when they see an XHTML document
with the correct XHTML [[MIME]] type.)

Also be aware that many popular [[JavaScript]] libraries and
developer tools have limited or no support for XHTML.

## Differences from HTML

See [Properly Using CSS and JavaScript in XHTML Documents](https://wiki.developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Properly_Using_CSS_and_JavaScript_in_XHTML_Documents)
for a partial list of differences between [[HTML]] and XHTML.
