# Slug

A Slug is the unique identifying part of a web address, typically at the end of the URL.
In the context of MDN, it is the portion of the URL following "`<locale>`/docs/".

It may also just be the final component when a new document is created under a parent document;
for example, this page's slug is `Glossary/Slug`.
