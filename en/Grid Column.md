# Grid Column

A **grid column** is a vertical track in a CSS Grid Layout, and is the space between two
vertical grid lines. It is defined by the `grid-template-columns` property or in the shorthand
`grid` or `grid-template` properties.

In addition, columns may be created in the implicit grid when items are placed outside of columns
created in the explicit grid. These columns will be auto-sized by default, or can have a size
specified with the `grid-auto-columns` property.

When working with alignment in CSS Grid Layout, the axis down which columns run is known as
the block, or column, axis.
