# Snap Positions

A scroll container may set **snap positions** — points that the scrollport
will stop moving at after a scrolling operation is completed. This allows a scrolling experience
that gives the effect of paging through content rather than needing to drag content into view.

Defining Snap positions on the scroll container was introduced in the CSS Scroll Snap specification.
