# SISD

SISD is short for **Single Instruction/Single Data** which is one
[classification of computer architectures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flynn%27s_taxonomy).
In SISD architecture, a single
processor executes a single instruction and operates on a single data point in memory.

See Also SIMD for a parallel architecture that allows one same operation to be performed
on multiple data points.
