# Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML)

The **Standard Generalized Markup Language** (**SGML**) is an [[ISO]] specification for defining
*declarative markup languages*.

On the [Web](/en/glossary/WWW), *HTML 4*, *[[XHTML]]*, and *[[XML]]* are popular *SGML*-based languages.
It is worth noting that since its fifth edition, [[HTML]] is no longer SGML-based and has its own
parsing rules.
