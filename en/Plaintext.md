# Plaintext

Plaintext refers to information that is being used as an input to an encryption
algorithm, or to ciphertext that has been decrypted.

It is frequently used interchangeably with the term cleartext, which more loosely refers
to any information, such as a text document, image, etc., that has not been encrypted
and can be read by a human or computer without additional processing.
