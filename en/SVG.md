TOPIC: Scalable Vector Graphics

# Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG)

**Scalable Vector Graphics** (**SVG**) is a **2D vector** image format based on an *[[XML]] syntax*.

The [[W3C]] began work on SVG in the late 1990s, but SVG only became popular when
*Internet Explorer 9* came out with SVG support. All major browsers now support SVG.

Based on an XML syntax, SVG can be styled with [[CSS]] and made interactive using JavaScript.
HTML5 now allows direct embedding of SVG TOPIC in an HTML document.

As a [vector image format](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_graphics), SVG graphics can scale
infinitely, making them invaluable in
**responsive design**, since you can create interface elements and graphics that scale to any screen
size. SVG also provides a useful set of tools, such as *clipping*, *masking*, *filters*, and *animations*.
