# Property

The term **property** can have several meanings depending on the context. It may refer to:

## Property (CSS)

A **CSS property** is a characteristic (like color) whose associated value defines one
aspect of how the browser should display the element.

Here's an example of a CSS rule:

```css
/* "div" is a selector indicating that all the div elements */
/* in the document will be styled by that rule */
div {
  /* The property "color" with the value "black" indicates */
  /* that the text will have the color black */
  color: black;

  /* The property "background-color" with the value "white" indicates */
  /* that the background color of the elements will be white */
  background-color: white;
}
```

## Property (Java​Script)

A **JavaScript property** is a characteristic of an object, often describing attributes
associated with a data structure.

There are two kinds of properties:

- Instance properties hold data that are specific to a given object instance.
- Static properties hold data that are shared among all object instances.

A property has a name (a string) and a value (primitive, method, or object reference).
Note that when we say that "a property holds an object", that is shorthand for "a
property holds an object reference".  This distinction matters because the original
referenced object remains unchanged when you change the property's value.
