# SIMD

SIMD (pronounced "sim-dee") is short for **Single Instruction/Multiple Data** which is
one [classification of computer architectures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flynn%27s_taxonomy).
SIMD allows one same operation to
be performed on multiple data points resulting in data level parallelism and thus
performance gains — for example, for 3D graphics and video processing, physics
simulations or cryptography, and other domains.

See Also SISD for a sequential architecture with no parallelism in either the
instructions or the data sets.
