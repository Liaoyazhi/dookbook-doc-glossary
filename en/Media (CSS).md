# Media (CSS)

In the context of CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), the term media refers to the destination to which the
document is to be drawn by the rendering engine. Typically, this is the device screen, but it may
also be a printer, a speech synthesizer, Braille display, or other type of device.

CSS supports a variety of features that allow one to alter the presentation of content depending on
the type of output media to which it's being rendered, or based upon individual properties of the
output media, such as width, resolution, or other values.
