# Syntax for Programming Language

**Syntax** specifies the **required combination and sequence of characters** making up *correctly structured
code*. Syntax varies from language to language (e.g., syntax is different in [[HTML]] and [[JavaScript]]).
Syntax applies both to *programming languages* (commands to the computer) and *markup
languages* (document structure information).

Syntax only governs **ordering** and **structure**; the instructions must also be meaningful,
which is the province of semantics.

Code must have correct syntax in order to compile correctly, otherwise a *syntax error* occurs.
Even small errors, like a missing parenthesis, can keep source code from compiling.

Frameworks are said to have a "**clean**" syntax if they produce simple, readable, concise results.
If a codebase uses "a lot of syntax", it requires more characters to achieve the same functionality.

## Statement

In a computer programming language, a **statement** is a line of code commanding a task.
Every program consists of a sequence of statements.

## Control Flow

The **control flow** is the **order** in which the computer executes *statements* in a programming language.

Code is run in order from the first line in the file to the last line, unless the computer runs
across the (extremely frequent) structures that change the control flow.

A typical programming language includes many control structures, including
**conditionals**, **loops** and **functions**.
Parts of a programming language may also be set to execute when
**events** occur.

### Conditional

A **condition** is a set of rules that can interrupt normal code execution or change it, depending
on whether the condition is completed or not.

An instruction or a set of instructions is executed, if a specific condition is fulfilled. Otherwise,
another instruction is executed. It is also possible to repeat the execution of an instruction,
or set of instructions, while a condition is not yet fulfilled.
