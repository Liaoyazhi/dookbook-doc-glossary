# Syntax for Programming Language

**Syntax** specifies the **required combination and sequence of characters** making up *correctly structured
code*. Syntax varies from language to language (e.g., syntax is different in [[HTML]] and [[JavaScript]]).
Syntax applies both to *programming languages* (commands to the computer) and *markup
languages* (document structure information).

Syntax only governs **ordering** and **structure**; the instructions must also be meaningful,
which is the province of semantics.

Code must have correct syntax in order to compile correctly, otherwise a *syntax error* occurs.
Even small errors, like a missing parenthesis, can keep source code from compiling.

Frameworks are said to have a "**clean**" syntax if they produce simple, readable, concise results.
If a codebase uses "a lot of syntax", it requires more characters to achieve the same functionality.

## Statement

In a computer programming language, a **statement** is a line of code commanding a task.
Every program consists of a sequence of statements.
