# First Interactive

!!! note
    Draft
    This page is not complete.

**First Interactive**, also known as first CPU idle, is a non-standard web performance metric
that measures when the user's window is quiet enough to handle user input,
or what is termed as minimally interactive.

Minimally interactive is defined as when some, but not necessarily all, UI elements on the page have
loaded and are interactive, and, on average, respond to user input in a reasonable amount of time.

## More information

First interactive is a variation of Time to Interactive, which is split into First
Interactive and Consistently Interactive. These metrics have been proposed by the Web Incubator
Community Group and are already being used in various tools. This metric has been
called First CPU Idle since Lighthouse 3.0
