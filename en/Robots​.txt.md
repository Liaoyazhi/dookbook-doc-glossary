# `robots​.txt`

`robots.txt` is a file which is usually placed in the root of any website. It decides
whether [crawlers](/en/glossary/Web_crawler) are permitted or forbidden access to the web site.

For example, the site admin can forbid [crawlers](/en/glossary/Web_Crawler) to visit a certain
folder (and all the files therein contained) or to crawl a specific file, usually to prevent those files
being indexed by other [search engines](/en/glossary/Search_Engine).
