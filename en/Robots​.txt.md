# Robots​.txt

Robots.txt is a file which is usually placed in the root of any website. It decides
whether crawlers are permitted or forbidden access to the web site.

For example, the site admin can forbid crawlers to visit a certain folder (and all the
files therein contained) or to crawl a specific file, usually to prevent those files
being indexed by other search engines.
