# XForms

!!! danger "Don't try this at home"
    **Obsolete**:
    This feature is obsolete. Although it may still work in some browsers, its use is discouraged since
    it could be removed at any time. Try to avoid using it.

**XForms** is a convention for building Web forms and processing form data in the XML format.
No major browser supports XForms any longer—we suggest using HTML5 forms instead.
