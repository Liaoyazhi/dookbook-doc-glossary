# Boolean Data Type

In computer science, a **Boolean** is a logical data type that can have only the values **true** or **false**.
For example, in JavaScript, Boolean conditionals are often used to decide which sections of code to
execute (such as in `if` statements or repeat (such as in `for` loops).

The Boolean value is named after English mathematician *[George Boole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George%20Boole)*,
who pioneered the field of *mathematical logic*.
