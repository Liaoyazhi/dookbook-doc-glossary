# Prototype-Based Programming

**Prototype-based programming** is a style of object-oriented programming in which
classes are not explicitly defined, but rather derived by adding properties and methods
to an instance of another class or, less frequently, adding them to an empty object.

In simple words: this type of style allows the creation of an object without first defining its class.
