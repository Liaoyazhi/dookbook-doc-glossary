# Google Chrome Browser

**Google Chrome** is a free [[Web browser]] developed by *Google*. It's based on the [Chromium](http://www.chromium.org/)
open source project. Some key differences are described on the [Chromium wiki](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/wiki/ChromiumBrowserVsGoogleChrome).
Chrome supports its own layout called **Blink**. Note that the iOS version of Chrome uses
that platform's *WebView*, not Blink.
