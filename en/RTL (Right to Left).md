# RTL (Right to Left)

**RTL (Right To Left)** is a locale property indicating that text is written from right
to left. For example, the `he` locale (for Hebrew) specifies right-to-left. Arabic (`ar`
is another common language written RTL.

The opposite of RTL, LTR (Left To Right) is used in other languages, including English
(`en`, `en-US`, `en-GB`, etc.), Spanish (`es`), and French (`fr`).
