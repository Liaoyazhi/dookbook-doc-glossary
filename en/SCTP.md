# SCTP

**SCTP** (Stream Control Transmission Protocol) is an IETF standard for a transport
protocol which enables the reliable, in-order transmission of messages while offering
congestion control, multi-homing, and other features to improve reliability and
stability of the connection. It's used for sending traditional telephone calls over the
Internet, but is also used for WebRTC data.
