# CSS Preprocessor

A **CSS preprocessor** is a program that lets you generate CSS from the preprocessor's own unique
syntax. There are many CSS preprocessors to choose from, however most CSS preprocessors will add
some features that don't exist in pure CSS, such as mixin, nesting selector, inheritance selector,
and so on. These features make the CSS structure more readable and easier to maintain.

To use a CSS preprocessor, you must install a CSS compiler on your web server.
