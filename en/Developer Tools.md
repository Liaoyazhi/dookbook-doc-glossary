# Developer Tools

Developer tools (or "development tools" or short "DevTools") are programs that allow a developer to
create, test and **debug** software.

Current browsers provide integrated developer tools, which allow to inspect a website.
They let users inspect and debug the page's HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, allow to inspect the network
traffic it causes, make it possible to measure it's performance, and much more.
