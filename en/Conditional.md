# Conditional

A **condition** is a set of rules that can interrupt normal code execution or change it, depending
on whether the condition is completed or not.

An instruction or a set of instructions is executed, if a specific condition is fulfilled. Otherwise,
another instruction is executed. It is also possible to repeat the execution of an instruction,
or set of instructions, while a condition is not yet fulfilled.
