# Domain Name System (DNS)

**DNS** (**Domain Name System**) translates easy-to-recall **domain names** to the numerical **IP addresses**
needed to find a particular computer service on the [[Internet]] or private network.

## Domain Name

A **domain name** is a website's **address** on the *[[Internet]]*. Domain names are used in
[[URL]]s to identify to which server belong a specific webpage. The domain name consists of a
hierarchial sequence of names (labels) separated by periods (dots `.`) and ending with an *extension*.
