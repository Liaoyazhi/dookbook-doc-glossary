# Domain Name System (DNS)

**DNS** (**Domain Name System**) translates easy-to-recall **domain names** to the numerical **IP addresses**
needed to find a particular computer service on the [[Internet]] or private network.

## Domain

A **domain** is an authority within the [[internet]] that controls its own resources. Its
"**domain name**" is a way to address this authority as part of the hierarchy in a [[URL]] - usually
the most memorable part of it, for instance a brand name.

A **fully qualified domain name** (**FQDN**) contains all necessary parts to look up this authority
by name unambiguously using the **DNS** system of the internet.

For example, in "`www.dookbook.info`":

1. "`info`" is called a **[top-level domain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top-level_domain)**.
They are registered as an internet standard by the [[IANA]].
Here, "`info`" means "infomation" which is defined in a top-level domain registry.

1. "`dookbook`" is the **domain**. If you like to own a domain you have to register it with one of
the many [registrars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_name_registrar) who are allowed to do
so with a top-level domain registry.

1. "`www`" is a "**sub-domain**", something you as the owner of a domain may define yourself. Many
owners choose to have a subdomain "`www`" to point to their [[World Wide Web]] resource, but that's not
required (and has even fallen somewhat out of favor).

## Domain Name

A **domain name** is a website's **address** on the *[[Internet]]*. Domain names are used in
[[URL]]s to identify to which server belong a specific webpage. The domain name consists of a
hierarchial sequence of names (labels) separated by periods (dots `.`) and ending with an *extension*.
