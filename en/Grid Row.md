# Grid Row

A **grid row** is a horizontal track in a CSS Grid Layout, that is the space between two
horizontal grid lines. It is defined by the `grid-template-rows` property or in the shorthand
grid or `grid-template` properties.

In addition, rows may be created in the implicit grid when items are placed outside of rows created
in the explicit grid. These rows will be auto sized by default, or can have a size specified with
the `grid-auto-rows` property.

When working with alignment in CSS Grid Layout, the axis along which rows run is known as the
inline, or row, axis.
