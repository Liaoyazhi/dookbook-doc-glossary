# Domain

A domain is an authority within the internet that controls its own resources. Its "domain name" is a
way to address this authority as part of the hierarchy in a URL - usually the most memorable part of
it, for instance a brand name.

A fully qualified domain name (FQDN) contains all necessary parts to look up this authority by name
unambigously using the DNS system of the internet.

For example, in "developer.mozilla.org":

1. "org" is called a [top-level domain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top-level_domain).
They are registered as an internet standard by the
[IANA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Assigned_Numbers_Authority).
Here, "org" means "organization" which is defined in a top-level domain registry.

1. "mozilla" is the domain. If you like to own a domain you have to register it with one of the many
[registrars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_name_registrar)
who are allowed to do so with a top-level domain registry.

1. "developer" is a "sub-domain", something you as the owner of a domain may define yourself. Many
owners choose to have a subdomain "www" to point to their World_Wide_Web resource, but that's not
required (and has even fallen somewhat out of favor).
