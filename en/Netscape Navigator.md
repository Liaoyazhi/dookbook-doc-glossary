# Netscape Navigator

Netscape Navigator or Netscape was a leading browser in the 1990s.  Netscape was based on Mosaic and
the Netscape team was led by Marc Andreessen, a programmer who also wrote code for Mosaic.

Netscape helped make the Web graphical rather than a text-only experience.  Many browsing features
became standard after Netscape introduced them. Netscape could display a webpage while loading,
used JavaScript for forms and interactive content, and stored session information in cookies.
Despite Netscape's technical advantages and initial dominance, by the late 1990s Internet Explorer
swiftly overtook Netscape in market share.
