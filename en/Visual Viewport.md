TOPIC: Visual Viewport

# Visual Viewport

The portion of the viewport that is currently visible is called the visual viewport.
This can be smaller than the layout viewport, such as when the user has pinched-zoomed.
The visual viewport is the visual portion of a screen excluding on-screen keyboards,
areas outside of a pinch-zoom area, or any other on-screen artifact that doesn't
scale with the dimensions of a page.
