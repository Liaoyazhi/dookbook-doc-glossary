# Character Encoding

An encoding defines a mapping between bytes and text. A sequence of bytes allows for different textual
interpretations. By specifying a particular encoding (such as UTF-8), we specify how the sequence of
bytes is to be interpreted.

For example, in HTML we normally declare a character encoding of UTF-8, using the following line:

>`<meta charset="utf-8">`
>This ensures that you can use characters from just about any human language in your HTML document,
and they will display reliably.
