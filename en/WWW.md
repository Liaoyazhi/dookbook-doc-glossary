# World Wide Web

The **World Wide Web** — commonly referred to as **WWW**, **W3**, or **the Web** — is an interconnected
system of public webpages accessible through the [[Internet]]. The Web is not the same as the [[Internet]]:
the Web is one of many applications built on top of the Internet.

*Tim Berners-Lee* proposed the architecture of what became known as the *World Wide Web*. He created
the first Web server, [[Web browser]], and webpage on his computer at the CERN physics research lab
in 1990. In 1991, he announced his creation on the *alt.hypertext* newsgroup,
marking the moment the Web was first made public.

## Components

The system we know today as "the Web" consists of several components:

- The **[[HTTP]]** protocol governs data transfer between a server and a client.

- To access a Web component, a client supplies a unique universal identifier, called a **[[URL]]**
(uniform resource location) or [[URI]] (uniform resource identifier)
(formally called *Universal Document Identifier* (*UDI*)).

- **[[HTML]]** (hypertext markup language) is the most common format for publishing web documents.
Linking, or connecting resources through [[hyperlink]]s, is a defining concept of the Web, aiding its
identity as a collection of connected documents.

Soon after inventing the Web, *Tim Berners-Lee* founded the W3C ([[World Wide Web Consortium]]) to
standardize and develop the Web further. This consortium consists of core Web interest groups,
such as web browser developers, government entities, researchers, and universities.
Its mission includes education and outreach.

## Web Standards

**Web standards** are rules established by international standards bodies and defining how how the Web
works (and sometimes controlling the Internet as well).

Several standards bodies are responsible for defining different aspects of the Web,
and all the standards must coordinate to keep the Web maximally usable and accessible.
Web standards also must evolve to improve the current status and adapt to new circumstances.

This non-exhaustive list gives you an idea of which standards
websites and network systems must conform to:

- **[[IETF]]** (*Internet Engineering Task Force*): Internet standards (STD), which among other
  things govern set-up and use of [[URI]]s, [[HTTP]], and MIME
- **[[W3C]]** and **[[WHATWG]]**: specifications for markup language (e.g., [[HTML]]), style
  definitions (i.e., CSS), DOM, accessibility
- **IANA** (Internet Assigned Numbers Authority): name and number registries
- **Ecma Intl.**: scripting standards, most prominently for [[JavaScript]]
- **[[ISO]]** (*International Organization for Standardization*): standards governing a diverse
  array of aspects, including *[[character encoding]]s*, *website management*, and
  *[[user interface]]* design
