TOPIC: Prerender

# Prerender

With prerendering, the content is prefetched and then the browser renders the
content in the background as if in an invisible separate tab. When the user navigates to
the prerendered content, the current content is replaced by the prerendered content instantly.

```html
<link rel="prerender" href="https://example.com/content/to/prerender">
```
