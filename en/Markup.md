# Markup

A markup language is one that is designed for defining and presenting text. HTML
(HyperText Markup Language), is an example of a markup language.

Within a text file such as an HTML file, elements are marked up using TOPIC which
explain the purpose of that part of the content.

## Types Of Markup Language

### Presentational Markup

Used by traditional word processing sytem with WYSIWYG (what you see it is what you get);
this is hidden from human authors, users and editors.

### Procedural Markup

Combined with text to provide instructions on text processing to programs. This text is
visibly manipulated by the author.

### Descriptive Markup

Labels sections of documents as to how the program should handle them. For example, the HTML
`<td>` defines a cell in a HTML table
