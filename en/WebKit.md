TOPIC: WebKit

# WebKit

**WebKit** is a framework that displays properly-formatted webpages based on their markup.
[[Apple Safari]] depends on *WebKit*, and so do many mobile browsers (since WebKit is highly portable
and customizable).

WebKit began life as a fork of KDE's *KHTML* and *KJS* libraries, but many individuals and companies
have since contributed (including KDE, Apple, Google, and Nokia).

WebKit is an Apple trademark, and the framework is distributed under a BSD-form license. However,
two important components fall under the *LGPL*: the **WebCore** rendering library and the
**JavaScriptCore** engine.
