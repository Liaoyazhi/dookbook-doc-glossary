TOPIC: WebKit

# WebKit

**WebKit** is an open source browser rendering framework that displays properly formatted web pages
based on their markup. [[Apple Safari]] depends on *WebKit*, and so do many mobile browsers (since
WebKit is highly portable and customizable). It has a clear source code structure and extremely fast
rendering speed.

WebKit began life as a fork of KDE's *KHTML* and *KJS* libraries, but many individuals and companies
have since contributed (including KDE, Apple, Google, and Nokia).

## License

WebKit is an *Apple* **trademark**, and the framework is distributed under a **BSD**-form license. However,
two important components fall under the *LGPL*: the *WebCore* rendering library and the
*JavaScriptCore* engine.
