# Progressive Web Apps

Progressive web apps is a term used to describe the modern state of web app development.
This involves taking standard web sites/apps that enjoy all the best parts of the Web —
such as discoverability via search engines, being linkable via URLs, and working across
multiple form factors — and supercharging them with modern APIs
(such as ServiceWorkers and Push) and features that confer other benefits
more commonly attributed to native apps.

These features include being installable, working offline, and being easy to sync with
and re-engage the user from the server.
