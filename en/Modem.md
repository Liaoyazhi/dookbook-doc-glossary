# Modem

A modem ("**mod**ulator-**dem**odulator") is a device that converts digital information to analog
signals and vice-versa, for sending data through networks. Different kinds are used for different
networks: DSL modems for telephone wires, WiFi modems for short-range wireless radio signals,
3G modems for cellular data towers, and so on.

Modems are different from routers, but many companies sell modems combined with routers.
