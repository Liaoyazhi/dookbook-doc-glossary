# Data Type

**Data Type**  (or **Type**) is a characteristic of a value affecting what kind of data it can
store — for example in JavaScript a `Boolean` only holds `true`/`false` values, whereas a
`String` holds text strings, a `Number` holds numbers of any kind, and so on.

A value's data type also affects which operations are valid on that value. For example, an integer
can be multiplied by an integer, but not by a string.

## Static Typing

A **statically-typed** language is a language (such as *[[Java]]*, *C*, or *C++*) where variable
types are known at **compile time**. In most of these languages, types must be expressly indicated
by the programmer; in other cases (such as *OCaml*),
type inference allows the programmer to not indicate their variable types.
