TOPIC: Data Type

# Data Type

**Data Type**  (or **Type**) is a characteristic of a value affecting what kind of data it can
store â€” for example in JavaScript a `Boolean` only holds `true`/`false` values, whereas a
`String` holds text strings, a `Number` holds numbers of any kind, and so on.

A value's data type also affects which operations are valid on that value. For example, an integer
can be multiplied by an integer, but not by a string.
