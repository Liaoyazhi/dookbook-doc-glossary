TOPIC: Data Type

# Data Type

**Data Type**  (or **Type**) is a characteristic of a value affecting what kind of data it can
store â€” for example in JavaScript a `Boolean` only holds `true`/`false` values, whereas a
`String` holds text strings, a `Number` holds numbers of any kind, and so on.

A value's data type also affects which operations are valid on that value. For example, an integer
can be multiplied by an integer, but not by a string.

## Static Typing

A **statically-typed** language is a language (such as *[[Java]]*, *C*, or *C++*) where variable
types are known at **compile time** by **compiler**. In most of these languages, types must be
expressly indicated by the programmer; in other cases (such as *OCaml*),
type inference allows the programmer to not indicate their variable types.

## Dynamic Typing

**Dynamically-typed** languages are those (like [[JavaScript]]) where the **interpreter** assigns variables
a type at **runtime** based on the variable's value at the time.

## Primitive

The **primitive** (primitive value, primitive data type) is data that is
not an object and has no methods.

Most of the time, a primitive value is represented directly at **the lowest level of the language implementation**.

All primitives are **immutable**, i.e., they cannot be altered. It is important not to
confuse a primitive itself with a variable assigned a primitive value. The variable may
be reassigned a new value, but the existing value can not be changed in the ways that
objects, arrays, and functions can be altered.
