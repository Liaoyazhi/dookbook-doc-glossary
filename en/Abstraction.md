TOPIC: Abstraction

# Abstraction

**Abstraction** in *computer programming* is a way to *reduce complexity* and allow efficient design
and implementation in complex software systems.
It hides the technical complexity of systems behind simpler APIs.

## Advantages of Data Abstraction

- Helps the user to avoid writing low level code.
- Avoids code duplication and increases reusability.
- Can change internal implementation of class independently without affecting the user.
- Helps to increase security of an application or
program as only important details are provided to the user.
