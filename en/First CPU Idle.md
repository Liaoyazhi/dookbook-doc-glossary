# First CPU Idle

**First CPU Idle** measures when a page is minimally interactive, or when the window is quiet enough
to handle user input. It is a non-standard Google web performance metric. Generally,
it occurs when most, but not necessarily all of visible UI elements are interactive, and the user
interface responds, on average, to most user input within 50ms. It is also known as First interactive.
