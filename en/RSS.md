# RSS

**RSS** (Really Simple Syndication) refers to several XML document formats designed for
publishing site updates. When you subscribe to a website's RSS feed, the website sends
information and updates to your RSS reader in an RSS document called a feed, so you
don't need to check all your favorite websites manually.
