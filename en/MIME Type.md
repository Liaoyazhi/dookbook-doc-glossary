# MIME Type

A **MIME type** (now properly called "media type", but also sometimes "content type") is a string
sent along with a file indicating the type of the file (describing the content format, for example,
a sound file might be labeled `audio/ogg`, or an image file `image/png`).

It serves the same purpose as filename extensions traditionally do on Windows. The name originates
from the MIME standard originally used in E-Mail.
