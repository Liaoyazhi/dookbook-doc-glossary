# Port

For a computer connected to a network with an IP address, a **port** is a communication
ndpoint. Ports are designated by numbers, and below 1024 each port is associated by
default with a specific protocol.

For example, the default port for the HTTP protocol is 80 and the default port for the
HTTPS protocol is 443, so a HTTP server waits for requests on those ports. Each Internet
protocol is associated with a default port: SMTP (25), POP3 (110), IMAP (143), IRC (194), and so on.
