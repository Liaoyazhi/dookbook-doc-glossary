# General Header

A **general header** is an HTTP header that can be used in both request and response messages but
doesn't apply to the content itself. Depending on the context they are used in, general headers are
either response or request headers. However, they are not entity headers.

The most common general headers are `Date`, `Cache-Control` or `Connection`.
