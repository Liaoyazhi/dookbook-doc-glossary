# Certificate Authority

A certificate authority (CA) is an organization that signs digital certificates and their
associated public keys. This certifies that an organization that requested a digital certificate
(e.g., Mozilla Corporation) is authorized to request a certificate for the
subject named in the certificate (e.g., mozilla.org).

Web browsers come preloaded with a list of certificate authorities trusted to issue digital certificates.
