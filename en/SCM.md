# SCM

SCM (Source Control Management) is a system for managing source code. Usually it refers
to the use of software to handle versioning of source files. A programmer can modify
source code files without being afraid of editing out useful stuff, because a SCM keeps
track of how the source code has changed and who made the changes.

Some SCM systems include CVS, SVN, GIT.
