# GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL)

**LGPL** (**GNU Lesser General Public License**) is a **free** **software license** published by
the *Free Software Foundation*. The LGPL provides a more permissive alternative for the strictly
copyleft **GPL**. While any derivative work using a GPL-licensed program must be released under the
same terms (free to use, share, study, and modify), the LGPL only requires the LGPL-licensed
component of the derivative program to continue using the LGPL, not the whole program. LGPL is
usually used to license shared components such as libraries (`.dll`, `.so`, `.jar`, etc.).
