TOPIC: Page Prediction

# Page Prediction

**Page Prediction** is a browser feature or script which, when enabled, tells the browser to download
resources the user is likely to visit before any user requests for the content are made.
Page prediction improves performance by enabling almost instant loading of predicted
content. However, page prediction may also download content a user does not request.

Some web applications include a prediction feature completing search text and address bar URLS based
on browsing history and/or related searches. For example, as the user types in the
address bar, the browser might send the current text in the address bar to the search
engine before the user submits the request.

While browser page prediction and prediction services enable faster page loads, badwidth
may be wasted and websites and any embedded content that are pre-loaded may set and read
their own cookies as if they were visited even if they weren't.
