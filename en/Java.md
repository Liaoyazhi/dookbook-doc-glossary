# Java Programming Language

**Java** is a **compiled**, **object-oriented**, **highly portable** *programming language*.

Java is **statically typed** and features a similar syntax to **C**. It comes with a large library
of readily usable functions, the **Java Software Development Kit** (**SDK**).

Programs are compiled only once ahead of time into a proprietary **byte code** and *package* format that
runs inside the **Java Virtual Machine** (JVM). The JVM is available across many platforms, which allows
Java programs to run almost everywhere without the need to be compiled or packaged again.
This makes it a preferred language in many large enterprises with heterogenous landscapes,
but may be perceived "heavy".
