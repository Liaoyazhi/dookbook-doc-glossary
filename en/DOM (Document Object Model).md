# DOM (Document Object Model)

The **DOM** (**Document Object Model**) is an **[API](/en/glossary/Application_Programming_Interface)**
that represents and interacts with any *[HTML](/en/glossary/HyperText_Markup_Language)* or *XML* document.
The DOM is a document model loaded in the browser and representing the document as a node tree, where
each node represents part of the document (e.g. an *element*, *text string*, or *comment*).

The DOM is one of the most-used [API](/en/glossary/Application_Programming_Interface)s on the
[Web](/en/glossary/World_Wide_Web) because it allows code running in a browser to access
and interact with every node in the document. Nodes can be created, moved and changed. Event listeners
can be added to nodes and triggered on occurrence of a given event.

DOM was not originally specifiedâ€”it came about when browsers began implementing [[JavaScript]]. This
legacy DOM is sometimes called **DOM 0**. Today, the
[WHATWG](/en/glossary/Web_Hypertext_Application_Technology_Working_Group) maintains the DOM Living Standard.
