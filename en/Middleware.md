# Middleware

Middleware is a (loosly defined) term for any software or service that enables the parts of a system
to communicate and manage data. It is the software that handles communication between components
and input/output, so developers can focus on the specific purpose of their application.

In server-side web application frameworks, the term is often more specifically used to refer to
pre-built software components that can be added to the framework's request/response processing
pipeline, to handle tasks such as database access.
