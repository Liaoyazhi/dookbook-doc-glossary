# Encapsulation

Encapsulation is the packing of data and functions into one component (for example, a class) and then
controlling access to that component to make a "blackbox" out of the object. Because of this,
a user of that class only needs to know its interface
(that is, the data and functions exposed outside the class), not the hidden implementation.
