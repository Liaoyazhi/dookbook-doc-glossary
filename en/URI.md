# Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)

A **URI** (Uniform Resource Identifier) is a string that refers to a resource. The most common are
*URL*s, which identify the resource by giving its location on the Web. *URN*s, by contrast, refer to
a resource by a name, in a given namespace, such as the *ISBN* of a book.

## Uniform Resource Locator (URL)

**Uniform Resource Locator** (*URL*) is a text string that specifies where a resource (such as a web
page, image, or video) can be found on the [[Internet]].

In the context of [[HTTP]], URLs are called "*Web address*" or "*link*". Your [[browser]] displays
URLs in its address bar, for example: `https://dookbook.info`. Some browsers display only the
part of a URL after the `//`, that is, the Domain name.

URLs can also be used for file transfer (**FTP**) , emails (**SMTP**), and other applications.

## Uniform Resource Name (URN)

URN (Uniform Resource Name) is a URI in a standard format, referring to a resource without specifying
its location or whether it exists. This example comes from [RFC 3986](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3986.txt):
`urn:oasis:names:specification:docbook:dtd:xml:4.1.2`
