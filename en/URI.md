# Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)

A **URI** (Uniform Resource Identifier) is a string that refers to a resource. The most common are
[[URL]]s, which identify the resource by giving its location on the Web. *URN*s, by contrast, refer to
a resource by a name, in a given namespace, such as the *ISBN* of a book.
