# Raster Image

A **raster image** is an image file defined as a grid of pixels. They’re also referred
to as bitmaps. Common raster image formats on the Web are JPEG, PNG, GIF, and [ICO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICO_(file_format)).

Raster image files usually contain one set of dimensions, but the ICO and CUR formats,
used for favicons and CSS cursor images, can contain multiple sizes.
