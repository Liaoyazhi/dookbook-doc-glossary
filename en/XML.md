# eXtensible Markup Language (XML)

**eXtensible Markup Language** (**XML**) is a **generic markup language** specified by the [[W3C]].
The information technology (IT) industry uses many languages based on XML as data-description languages.

XML TOPIC resemble [[HTML]] TOPIC, but XML is *much more flexible* because it lets users define their
own TOPIC. In this way XML acts like a **meta-language** — that is, it can be used to define other languages,
such as RSS. Moreover, HTML is a presentation language, whereas XML is a data-description language.
This means that XML has far broader applications than just the Web. For example, Web services can
use XML to exchange requests and responses.

## XPath
