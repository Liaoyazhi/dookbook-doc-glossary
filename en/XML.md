# eXtensible Markup Language (XML)

**eXtensible Markup Language** (**XML**) is a **generic markup language** specified by the [[W3C]].
The information technology (IT) industry uses many languages based on XML as data-description languages.

XML TOPIC resemble [[HTML]] TOPIC, but XML is *much more flexible* because it lets users define their
own TOPIC. In this way XML acts like a **meta-language** — that is, it can be used to define other languages,
such as RSS. Moreover, HTML is a presentation language, whereas XML is a data-description language.
This means that XML has far broader applications than just the Web. For example, Web services can
use XML to exchange requests and responses.

## XPath

**XPath** is a **query language** that can access sections and content in an XML document.

## XQuery

**XQuery** is a computer language for updating, retrieving, and calculating data in **XML databases**.

## XLink

**XLink** is a *[[W3C]] standard* which is used to describe **links** between XML and XML or other documents.
Some its behaviors are left to the implementation to determine how to handle.

XLink is used in [[SVG]], [[MathML]], and other important standards.
