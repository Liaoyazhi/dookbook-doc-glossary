# REST

Representational State Transfer (**REST**) refers to a group of software architecture
design constraints that bring about efficient, reliable, and scalable distributed
systems. A system is called RESTful when it adheres to those constraints.

The basic idea of REST is that a resource, e.g. a document, is transferred with its
state and relationships (hypertext) via well-defined, standardized operations and
formats. Often API's or services call themselves RESTful when they directly modify  a
type of document as opposed to triggering actions elsewhere.

Because HTTP, the standard protocol behind the Web, also transfers documents and
hypertext links, simple HTTP APIs are sometimes colloquially referred to as RESTful APIs
RESTful services, or simply REST services, although they don't necessarily adhere to all
REST constraints. Beginners can assume a REST API means an HTTP service that can be
called using standard web libraries and tools.
