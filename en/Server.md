# Server

A server is a software or hardware offering a service to a user, usually referred to as client.
A hardware server is a shared computer on a network, usually powerful and housed in a data center.
A software server (often running on a hardware server) is a program that provides services to
client programs or a user interface to human clients.

Services are provided generally over local area networks or wide area networks such as
the internet. A client program and server program traditionally connect by passing
messages encoded using a protocol over an API.

For example:

- An Internet-connected Web server is sending a HTML file to your browser software so
that you can read this page
- Local area network server for file, name, mail, print, and fax
- Minicomputers, mainframes, and super computers at data centers
