# Blink

**Blink** is an open-source [browser](/en/glossary/Web_browser) layout engine developed by *Google* as
part of Chromium (and therefore part of [Chrome](/en/glossary/Google_Chrome_Browser) as well).
Specifically, Blink began as a fork of the **WebCore** library in **[[WebKit]]**, which handles
layout, rendering, and [[DOM]], but now stands on its own as a separate rendering engine.
