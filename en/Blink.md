# Blink

Blink is an open-source browser layout engine developed by Google as part of Chromium (and therefore
part of Chrome as well). Specifically, Blink began as a fork of the WebCore library in WebKit,
which handles layout, rendering, and DOM, but now stands on its own as a separte rendering engine.
