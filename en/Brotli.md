# Brotli

**Brotli** is a general-purpose lossless compression algorithm. It compresses data using a
combination of a modern variant of the LZ77 algorithm, Huffman coding, and second-order context modeling,
providing a compression ratio comparable to the best currently available general-purpose compression
methods.Brotli provides better compression ratios than gzip and deflate speeds are comparable,
but brotli compressing is a slower process than Gzip compression, so gzip may be a better option for
the compression of non-cachable content.

Brotli is compatible with most modern browsers, but you may want to consider a fallback.
