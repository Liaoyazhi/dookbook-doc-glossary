TOPIC: Web Performance

# Web performance

Web performance is the objective time from when a request for content is made until the requested
content is displayed in the user's browser, objective render times, and the subjective user
experience of load time and runtime. Objectively, it is measurable time, in milliseconds, it takes
for the web page or web application to be downloaded, painted in the user's web browser, and become
responsive and interactive. It is the frames per second and times the main thread is not available
for user user interactions. Subjectively, it is the user's perception of whether the time it takes
between the time the user requests the content and the time until the user feels the content requested
is available and usable feels slow or fast.
