# Garbage Collection

Garbage collection is a term used in computer programming to describe the process of finding
and deleting objects which are no longer being referenced by other objects. In other words, garbage
collection is the process of removing any objects which are not being used by any other objects.
Often abbreviated "GC," garbage collection is a fundamental component of the memory management
system used by JavaScript.
