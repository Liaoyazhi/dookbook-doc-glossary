# Lazy Load

**Lazy loading** is a strategy that delays the loading of some assets until they are needed by the
user based on the user's activity or navigation pattern. If correctly implemented, this delay in asset
loading is seamless to the user experience and might help improve initial load performance,
including time to interactive, as fewer assets are required for the page to start working.
