# HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP)

The **HyperText Transfer Protocol** (**HTTP**) is the underlying network protocol that enables transfer
of hypermedia documents on the Web, typically between a [[browser]] and a server so that humans can
read them. The current version of the HTTP specification is called *HTTP/2*.

As part of a [[URI]], the `"http://"` is called "schema" and usually stands at the beginning of an address,
for instance in "[https://dookbook.info](https://dookbook.info)" to indicate to
the browser to request the document using the HTTP protocol. The **https** in this case refers to the
secure version of the HTTP protocol, **SSL** (also called **TLS**).

HTTP is **textual** (all communication is done in plain text) and **stateless** (no communication is
aware of previous communications). This property makes it ideal for humans to read documents (Web sites)
on the [[World Wide Web]]. However, HTTP can also be used as a basis for *REST* web services from
server to server or *AJAX* requests within web sites to make them more dynamic.
