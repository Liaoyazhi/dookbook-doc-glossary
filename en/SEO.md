# Search Engine Optimization (SEO)

**SEO** (**Search Engine Optimization**) is the process of making a website more visible in
search results, also termed **improving search rankings**.

[[Search engine]]s crawl the web, following links from page to page, and index the content
found. When you search, the search engine displays the indexed content.
[Crawlers](/en/glossary/Web_Crawler) follow rules. If you follow those rules closely when doing
SEO for a website, you give the site the best chances of showing up among the first results,
increasing traffic and possibly revenue (for e-commerce and ads).

[[Search engine]]s give some guidelines for SEO, but big search engines keep result ranking
as a *trade secret*. SEO combines official search engine guidelines, empirical knowledge,
and theoretical knowledge from science papers or patents.

## SEO Methods

SEO methods fall into three broad classes:

### Technical

Tag the content using **semantic** [[HTML]]. When exploring the website,
[crawlers](/en/glossary/Web_Crawler) should only find the content you want indexed.

### Copywriting

Write content using your visitors' *vocabulary*. Use **text** as well as **images** so that
[crawlers](/en/glossary/Web_Crawler) can understand the subject.

### Popularity

You get most traffic when other established sites **link** to your site.
