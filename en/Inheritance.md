# Inheritance

Inheritance is a major feature of object-oriented programming.  Data abstraction can be carried up
several levels, that is, classes can have superclasses and subclasses.

As an app developer, you can choose which of the superclass's attributes and methods to keep and add
your own, making class definition very flexible. Some languages let a class inherit from more than
one parent (multiple inheritance).
