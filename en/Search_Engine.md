# Search Engine

A **search engine** is a software system that collects information from the [[World Wide Web]]
and presents it to users who are looking for specific information.

A search engine conducts the following processes:

- **Web crawling**: Searching web sites by navigating **Hyperlinks** on web pages,
both within a site, and from one site to another. A web site owner can exclude areas of
the site from being accessed by a search engine's **[[web crawler]]** (or spider), by defining
"robot exclusion" information in a file named **[`robots.txt`](/en/glossary/Robots.txt)**.
- **Indexing**: Associating **keywords** and other information with specific web pages that
have been crawled. This enables users to find relevant pages as quickly as possible.
- **Searching**: Looking for relevant web pages based on queries consisting of **keywords**
and other commands to the search engine. The search engine finds the [[URL]]s of pages that
match the query, and *ranks* them based on their **relevance**. It then presents results to
the user in order of the ranking.

The most popular search engine is **Google**. Other top search engines include *Bing*, *Baidu*, and *AOL*.
