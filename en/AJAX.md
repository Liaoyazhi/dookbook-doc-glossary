# Asynchronous JavaScript And XML (AJAX)

**Asynchronous JavaScript And XML** (**AJAX**) is a programming practice of building more complex,
dynamic webpages using a technology known as `XMLHttpRequest`.

What AJAX allows you to do is just update parts of the [[DOM]] of a HTML webpage instead of having
to reload the entire page. AJAX also lets you work **asynchronously**, meaning your code continues to
run while that part of your webpage is trying to reload (compared to synchronously which will block
your code from running until that part of your webpage is done reloading).

Although "X" in Ajax stands for *[[XML]]*, *[[JSON]]* is used more than XML nowadays because of its
many advantages such as being lighter and a part of JavaScript. Both JSON and XML are used for
packaging information in the Ajax model.

With interactive websites and modern web standards, AJAX is gradually being replaced by functions
within JavaScript frameworks and the official **`Fetch` API** Standard.
