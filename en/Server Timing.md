# Server Timing

The [Server Timing specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/server-timing/) enables the server to
communicate performance
metrics about the request-response cycle to the user agent, and a JavaScript interface
to enable applications to collect, process, and act on these metrics to optimize application delivery.
