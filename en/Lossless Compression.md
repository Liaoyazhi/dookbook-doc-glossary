TOPIC: Lossless Compression

# Lossless Compression

**Lossless compression** is a class of data compression algorithms that allows the original data to
be perfectly reconstructed from the compressed data. Lossless compression methods are reversible
compression methods. Examples of lossless compression include GZIP, Brotli, WebP, and PNG,

Lossy compression, on the other hand, uses inexact approximations, discarding some data from
the original file, making it an irreversible compression method.
