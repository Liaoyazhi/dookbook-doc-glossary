TOPIC: Internationalization

# Internationalization

**Internationalization**, often shortened to i18n, is the adapting of a web site or web
application to different languages, regional differences, and technical requirements for different
regions and countries. Internationalization is the process of architecting your web application so
that it can be quickly and easiliy adapted to various languages and regions without much engineering
effort when new languages and regions are supported, and so that a user can use browser features to
translate or localize the application as to access all the content without breaking the layout.

Internationalization includes support for multiple character sets (usually via [Unicode](http://searchcio-midmarket.techtarget.com/definition/Unicode)),
units of measure (currency, °C/°F, km/miles, etc.),
date and time formats, keyboard layouts, and layout and text directions.
