TOPIC: Dynamic Programming Language

# Dynamic Programming Language

A **dynamic programming language** is a programming language in which operations otherwise done at
compile-time can be done at **run-time**. For example, in JavaScript it is possible to change the type
of a variable or add new properties or methods to an object while the program is running.

This is opposed to so-called *static programming languages*, in which such changes are normally not possible.

!!! note
    Note that while there is indeed a connection between this dynamic/static property of programming
    languages and dynamic/static-typing, the two are far from synonymous.
