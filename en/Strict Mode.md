TOPIC: Strict Mode

# Strict Mode

JavaScript's **strict mode** is a way to opt in to a restricted variant of JavaScript, thereby implicitly
opting-out of "sloppy mode". Strict mode isn't just a subset: it intentionally has different
semantics from normal code.

Strict mode for an entire script is invoked by including the
statement `"use strict";`  before any other statements.
