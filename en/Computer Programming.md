# Computer Programming

Computer programming is a process of composing and organizing a collection of instructions.
These tell a computer/software program what to do in a language which the computer understands.
These instructions come in the form of many different languages such as C++,
Java, JavaScript, HTML, Python, Ruby, and Rust.  

Using an appropriate language, you can program/create all sorts of software. For example,
a program that helps scientists with complex calculations, a database that stores huge
amounts of data, a web site that allows people to download music, or animation software
that allows people to create animated movies.
