# DOM (Document Object Model)

The **DOM** (**Document Object Model**) is an **[[API]]** that represents and interacts with
any *[[HTML]]* or *XML* document.
The DOM is a document model loaded in the [browser](/en/glossary/Web_browser) and representing the
document as a **node tree**, where each node represents part of the document
(e.g. an *element*, *text string*, or *comment*).

The DOM is one of the most-used [[API]]s on the
[Web](/en/glossary/World_Wide_Web) because it allows code running in a browser to access
and interact with every node in the document. Nodes can be created, moved and changed. *Event listeners*
can be added to nodes and triggered on occurrence of a given event.

DOM was not originally specifiedâ€”it came about when browsers began implementing [[JavaScript]]. This
legacy DOM is sometimes called *DOM 0*. Today, the [[WHATWG]] maintains the DOM Living Standard.
