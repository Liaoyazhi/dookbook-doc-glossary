# Gaia

The user interface and default application suite of the Firefox OS platform.

Once Firefox OS starts, anything drawn to screen is a product of the Gaia layer (e.g., the lock screen,
home screen, standard apps). Gaia is implemented entirely with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and its
only interfaces to the underlying operating system are through open Web APIs, which the Gecko layer
implements. You can install third-party apps alongside Gaia.
