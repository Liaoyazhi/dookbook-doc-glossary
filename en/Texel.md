# Texel

A **texel** is a single pixel within a texture map, which is an image that gets used
(in whole or in part) as the image presented on a polygon's surface within a 3D rendered image.
The process of mapping the appropriate texels to their corresponding points on a polygon is called
**texture mapping**, which is a stage of the process of rendering a 3D image for display.
Texture mapping is typically done prior to lighting the scene; however, in WebGL,
lighting is performed as part of the texture mapping process.
