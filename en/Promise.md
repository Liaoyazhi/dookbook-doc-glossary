# Promise

A Promise is an object that's returned by a function that has not yet completed
its work. The promise literally represents a promise made by the function that it will
eventually return a result through the promise object.

When the called function finishes its work asynchronously, a function on the promise
object called a resolution (or fulfillment, or completion) handler is called to let the
original caller know that the task is complete.
