# FTP

**FTP** (File Transfer Protocol) was the standard protocol for many years for transferring files
from one host to another over the Internet. Increasingly, though, teams and hosting accounts don't
allow FTP and instead rely on a version control system like Git. You will still find it used on older
hosting accounts, but it is safe to say that FTP is no longer considered best practice.
