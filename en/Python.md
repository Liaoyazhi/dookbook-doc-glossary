# Python

**Python** is a high level general-purpose programming language. It uses a
multi-paradigm approach, meaning it supports procedural, object-oriented, and some
functional programming constructs.

It was created by Guido van Rossum as a successor to another language (called ABC)
between 1985 and 1990, and is currently used on a large array of domains like web
development, desktop applications, data science, DevOps, and automation/productivity.

Python is developed under an OSI-approved open source license, making it freely usable
and distributable, even for commercial use. Python's license is administered by the
Python Software Foundation.
