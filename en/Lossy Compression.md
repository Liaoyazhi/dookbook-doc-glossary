# Lossy Compression

**Lossy compression**, or irreversible compression, are data encoding methods. Compression reduces
the number of bytes needed to upload, download, and store images. Lossy compression uses inexact
approximations and partial data discarding to represent content.

Lossy compression is used in media formats such as JPEG. When images are not compressed,
three numbers, one for each of the red, green and blue components, are needed for each pixel,
leading to huge file sizes. Lossy compression means that some data from the original image file is
lost. This process is irreversible. Images that were compressed this way should
generally not be further edited.

**Lossless compression** is a class of data compression algorithms that allows the original data to be
perfectly reconstructed from the compressed data. Lossless compression methods are reversible.
Examples of lossless compression include GZIP, Brotli, WebP, and PNG,

Lossy compression, on the other hand, uses inexact approximations by discarding some data from the
original file, making it an irreversible compression method.
