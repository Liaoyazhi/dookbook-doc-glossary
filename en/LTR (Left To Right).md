# LTR (Left To Right)

**LTR (Left To Right)** is a locale property indicating that text is written from left to right.
For example, the `en-US` locale (for US English) specifies left-to-right. Most Western languages,
as well as many others around the world, are written LTR.

The opposite of LTR, RTL (Right To Left) is used in other common languages, including Arabic (`ar`)
and Hebrew (`he`).
