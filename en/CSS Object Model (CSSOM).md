The CSS Object Model (CSSOM) is a map of all CSS selectors and relevant properties for each selector
in the form of tree, with root node, sibling, descendant, child and other relationship. The CSSOM is
very similar to the Document Object Model (DOM). Both of them are part of the critical rendering path
which is a series of steps that must happen to properly render a website.

The CSSOM, together with the DOM, to build the render tree,
which is in turn used by the browser to layout and paint the web page.

It is much like the DOM, but for the CSS rather than the HTML.
