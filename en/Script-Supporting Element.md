# Script-Supporting Element

In an HTML document, **script-supporting elements** are those elements that don't
directly contribute to the appearance or layout of the page; instead, they're either
scripts or contain information that's only used by scripts. These elements may be
important, but do not affect the displayed page unless the page's scripts explicitly
cause them to do so.

There are only two script-supporting elements: `<script>` and `<template>`.
