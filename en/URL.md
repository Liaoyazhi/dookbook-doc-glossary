TOPICS: Uniform Resource Locator

# Uniform Resource Locator (URL)

**Uniform Resource Locator** (*URL*) is a text string that specifies where a resource (such as a web
page, image, or video) can be found on the Internet.

In the context of HTTP, URLs are called "*Web address*" or "*link*". Your browser displays URLs in
its address bar, for example: `https://developer.mozilla.org`. Some browsers display only the
part of a URL after the `//`, that is, the Domain name.

URLs can also be used for file transfer (**FTP**) , emails (**SMTP**), and other applications.
