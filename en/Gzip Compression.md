# Gzip Compression

Gzip is a file format used for file compression and decompression. It is based on the Deflate algorithm
that allows files to be made smaller in size which allows for faster network transfers. Gzip is commonly
supported by web servers and modern browsers, meaning that servers can automatically compress files
with Gzip before sending them, and browsers can uncompress files upon receiving them.
