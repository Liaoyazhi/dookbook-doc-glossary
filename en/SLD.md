# SLD

An SLD (Second Level Domain) is the domain name that is located right before a TLD.

For example, in `mozilla.org`, `mozilla` is the second level domain of the `.org` TLD.

A domain name is not limited to a TLD and an SLD. Additional subdomains can be created in order to
provide additional information about various functions of a server or to delimit areas under the
same domain. For example, `www` is a commonly used subdomain to indicate the domain points to a web server.

As another example, in `developer.mozilla.org`, the
`developer` subdomain is used to specify that the subdomain
contains the developer section of the mozilla website.
