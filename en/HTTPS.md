# HTTPS

**HTTPS** (HTTP Secure) is an encrypted version of the HTTP protocol. It usually uses SSL or TLS to
encrypt all communication between a client and a server. This secure connection allows clients to safely
exchange sensitive data with a server, for example for banking activities or online shopping.
