# Block

The term **block** can have several meanings depending on the context. It may refer to:

## Block (CSS)

A **block** on a webpage is an HTML element that appears on a new line, i.e. underneath the
preceding element in a horizontal writing mode, and above the following element (commonly known as
a block-level element). For example, `<p>` is by default a block-level element, whereas `<a>` is an
inline element — you can put several links next to one another in your HTML source and they will sit
on the same line as one another in the rendered output.

Using the `display` property you can change whether an element displays inline or as a block
(among many other options); **blocks** are also subject to the effects of positioning schemes and
use of the `position` property.

## Block (scripting)

In JavaScript, a block is a collection of related statements enclosed in braces ("{}"). For example,
you can put a block of statements after an `if (condition)` block, indicating that the interpreter
should run the code inside the block if the condition is true,
or skip the whole block if the condition is false.
