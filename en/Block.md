# Block

The term **block** can have several meanings depending on the context. It may refer to:

Block (CSS)
:   A **block** on a webpage is an HTML element that appears on a new line, i.e.
    underneath the preceding element in a horizontal writing mode, and above the following element
    (commonly known as a block-level element). For example, `<p>` is by default a block-level
    element, whereas `<a>` is an inline element â€” you can put several links next to one another
    in your HTML source and they will sit on the same line as one another in the rendered output.

Block (scripting)
:   In JavaScript, a block is a collection of related statements enclosed in braces ("{}"). For example,
    you can put a block of statements after an `if (condition)` block, indicating that the interpreter
    should run the code inside the block if the condition is true, or skip the whole block if
    the condition is false.
